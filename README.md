# Port Scanning and Web Service Interaction Tool

This tool is designed to:

1. Scan a specific IP address for open ports within a specified range.
2. For each open port found, it sends HTTP requests to a list of known endpoints (paths) to fetch and display their responses.
3. Depending on the endpoint, the tool might POST data to the service, retrieve certain information (like a secret or user level), and use this information in subsequent requests to other endpoints.

## Components and Explanation:

### Data Structures:

- `Challenge`, `Content`, `SubmitSolutionBody`: Data structures representing the body of POST requests for specific endpoints.
- `ResponseDetails`: Struct to capture details of an HTTP response.
- `PostBody`: General struct used for most POST requests.

### Main Functions:

- `CheckPort(host string, port int, timeout time.Duration) bool`: Checks if a specific port is open on a host.
- `FindOpenPorts(host string, start, end int, timeout time.Duration) []int`: Uses goroutines to scan a range of ports concurrently and returns a list of open ports.
- `FetchDetails(ip string, port int, path string) ResponseDetails`: Makes a GET request to a given IP, port, and path, and returns the response details.
- `postBodyToCheckResponse(ip string, port int, path string, body interface{}) ([]byte, error)`: POSTs a JSON body to a specified endpoint and returns the response.

### Execution Flow:

1. Load configurations from a `.env` file: IP, start port, end port, and timeout.
2. Scan the IP for open ports within the given range.
3. For each open port found:
   - Fetch details from each known endpoint.
   - If the endpoint is `/getUserSecret`, a loop tries to fetch a secret until successful.
   - The secret fetched is then used for other endpoints.
   - If the endpoint is `/getUserLevel`, it fetches the user level.
   - If the endpoint is `/submitSolution`, it uses the previously fetched secret and user level to submit a solution.

## Usage:

1. Ensure you have a `.env` file in the root with the following variables: `IP`, `START_PORT`, `END_PORT`, and `TIMEOUT`.
2. Run `source .env` to load the variables into your environment.
3. Run the program using `go run main.go`.

## Note:

- The order of the paths in the list matters since some endpoints require information fetched from previous ones.
- The secret key for the `/submitSolution` endpoint currently has a humorous placeholder quote about pasting code. Ensure it's the right key for your application.
